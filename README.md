# Flower Classifier Command Line Application

This command-line application is designed to train a neural network on a dataset and use the trained model to predict the class of a flower in an image. It consists of two main scripts:

- `train.py` for training a model and saving it as a checkpoint, and
- `predict.py` for predicting the class of an image using a trained model checkpoint.
